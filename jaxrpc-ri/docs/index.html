  <title>Java(tm) API for XML-based RPC</title>

    <h1>Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API for XML-based RPC (JAX-RPC) 1.1.3_01 EA</h1>
  </center>
  <hr>

  <p>JAX-RPC is an API for building Web services and clients that used remote procedure calls (RPC) and XML. Often used in a distributed client/server model, an RPC mechanism enables clients to execute procedures on other systems. In JAX-RPC, a remote procedure call is represented by an XML-based protocol such as SOAP. The SOAP specification defines envelope structure, encoding rules, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. These calls and responses are transmitted as SOAP messages over HTTP.</p>

  <p>With JAX-RPC, clients and Web services have a big advantage--the platform independence of the Java programming language. In addition, JAX-RPC is not restrictive: a JAX-RPC client can access a Web service that is not running on the Java platform and vice versa. This flexibility is possible because JAX-RPC uses technologies defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): HTTP, SOAP, and the Web Service Description Language (WSDL). WSDL specifies an XML format for describing a service as a set of endpoints operating on messages.</p>
