X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1) describes an open,
            standards-based "binary XML" format that is based on the XML Information Set [<a href="#Infoset"><span class="abbrev">XML Information Set</span></a>]. JWSDP 2.0 now supports this optimized encoding as part of
            JAX-RPC 1.1.3_01 EA. For ease of deployment, this new version of JAX-RPC also support a form
            of HTTP content negotiation that can be used to "turn on" Fast Infoset during message
            exchanges. By default, the Fast Infoset encoding is turned off. For more information on
            how to use this feature see <a href="#Using-FI" title="Using Fast Infoset">the section called &#8220;Using Fast Infoset&#8221;</a>.</p><p>The XML Information Set specifies the result of parsing an XML document, referred to
            as an XML infoset (or simply an infoset), and a glossary of terms to identify infoset
            components, referred to as information items and properties. An XML infoset is an
            abstract model of the information stored in an XML document; it establishes a separation
            between data and information in a way that suits most common uses of XML. In fact,
            several of the concrete XML data models are defined by referring to XML infoset items
            and their properties. For example, SOAP Version 1.2 [<a href="#SOAP"><span class="abbrev">SOAP 1.2</span></a>] makes use of
            this abstraction to define the information in a SOAP message without ever referring to
            XML 1.X, and the SOAP HTTP binding specifically allows for alternative media types that
            "provide for at least the transfer of the SOAP XML Infoset".</p><p>The Fast Infoset specification is jointly standardized at the ITU-T and ISO. As of
            this writing, the ISO Final Committee Draft ballot has been completed, and the
            specification has gone for Consent to Last Call at the ITU-T Study Group 17 meeting in
            Moscow, 30 March - 8 April 2005. The specification is available to all ITU-T sector
            members and can also be obtained via the corresponding ISO national body in your
            location. These specifications recommend the use of the MIME type
                <code class="filename">application/fastinfoset</code>, which has recently been approved by
            the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for documents serialized using this
            format.</p><p>Fast Infoset @ Java.net [<a href="#FI-Java.net"><span class="abbrev">Fast Infoset @ Java.net</span></a>] is an open-source project
            initiated by Sun Microsystems to provide access to a fast, fully-featured and robust
            implementation of the Fast Infoset specification. JAX-RPC 1.1.3_01 EA employs the basic Fast
            Infoset parsers and serializers that are available from that project.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Using-FI"></a>Using Fast Infoset</h2></div></div></div><p>Content negotiation is completely <span class="emphasis"><em>driven by the client</em></span> and uses
            the standard HTTP headers <code class="filename">Accept</code> and
            <code class="filename">Content-Type</code>. The initial request is always encoded in XML, but the
            client has the option of including the MIME type
            <code class="filename">application/fastinfoset</code> as part of the
            <code class="filename">Content-Type</code> list. If the request is received by a Fast
            Infoset-enabled service, the reply will be encoded in Fast Infoset. The remainder of the
            conversation between the client and the service will also be encoded in Fast Infoset as
            long as the client continues to use the same artifact (e.g., the same stub instance) to
            converse with the server. We call this form of negotiation as
            <span class="emphasis"><em>pessimistic</em></span>, in contrast to the <span class="emphasis"><em>optimistic</em></span>
            case, in which a client directly initiates a message exchange using the more efficient
            encoding.</p><p>Content negotiation can be enabled in two different ways: (i) by setting a system
            property on the VM used to run the client, and (ii) by setting a property on the
            static/dynamic stub or DII instance of <code class="filename">Call</code> used by the client. In
            either case, both the property name and its value are identical.</p><p>A system-wide property can be set using the -D option of the Java command, as shown
            below: </p><div class="example"><a name="d0e76"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Setting the System Property</b></p><pre class="programlisting">        java -Dcom.sun.xml.rpc.client.ContentNegotiation=pessimistic ...</pre></div><p> The following example shows how set the property on a stub:</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e82"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Setting Content Negotiation on a Stub</b></p><pre class="programlisting">        stub = ...;    // Obtain reference to stub
        stub._setProperty(
             com.sun.xml.rpc.client.StubPropertyConstants.CONTENT_NEGOTIATION_PROPERTY,
             "pessimistic");     </pre></div><p> These properties accept one of two values: <code class="filename">none</code> and
                <code class="filename">pessimistic</code>, with the former set as the default. If the client
            uses a Dynamic Instance Invocation (DII), the same property can be set as follows: </p><div class="example"><a name="d0e94"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Setting Content Negotiation on an instance of Call</b></p><pre class="programlisting">        call = ...;    // Obtain reference to call
        call.setProperty(
             com.sun.xml.rpc.client.dii.CallPropertyConstants.CONTENT_NEGOTIATION_PROPERTY,
             "pessimistic");     </pre></div><p> Even though a different Java constant was used in the DII case, the actual
            name of the property is the same as in the previous two examples (i.e.,
                <code class="filename">com.sun.xml.rpc.client.ContentNegotiation</code>). </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e103"></a>Base64 Data</h2></div></div></div><p>Because XML is a textual format, binary blobs must be represented using character
            sequences before they can be embedded in an XML document. A popular encoding that
            permits this embedding is known as base64 encoding, and it corresponds to the XML Schema
            data type xsd:base64Binary. In a Web services toolkit that supports a binding framework,
            as it is the case in JAX-RPC, a value of this type must be encoded before transmission
            and decoded before binding. The encoding and decoding process is expensive and linear to
            the size of the binary object.</p><p>JAX-RPC 1.1.3_01 EA provides support for the so-called Fast Infoset base64 encoding
            algorithm. This is one of several built-in encoding algorithms in Fast Infoset that
            facilitate the encoding of character chunks (or text nodes) using a more efficient
            representation. More specifically, in the case of value of type xsd:base64Binary, byte
            sequences that are used to represent these blobs in memory can be parsed and serialized
            directly without the need for any encoding or decoding step. In JAX-RPC 1.1.3_01 EA, this
            optimization is supported only for element content of type xsd:base64Binary; it is
            currently <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> supported for attribute values.</p><p>The SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism [<a href="#MTOM"><span class="abbrev">MTOM</span></a>], paired
            with the XML-binary Optimized Packaging [<a href="#XOP"><span class="abbrev">XOP</span></a>], was proposed to address
            the inefficiencies related to the transmission of binary data in SOAP documents. This
            solution proposes a method in which XML messages are dissected in order to transmit
            binary blobs as MIME attachments in a way that is transparent to the application. It is
            worth pointing out that, in order to preserve full infoset fidelity, this transformation
            is restricted to base64 content in canonical form as defined in [<a href="#XSD-Datatypes"><span class="abbrev">XSD Datatypes</span></a>]. </p><p> Conceptually, Fast Infoset and MTOM/XOP are similar enough with respect to the
            management of binary data. In particular, supporting either of them requires Web
            services toolkits to be updated to avoid base64 encoding and decoding during parsing and
            data binding. We believe Fast Infoset's solution is not only much simpler to implement
            (it is a binary format after all!) but is likely to result in even better performance
            because there is no need to use a packaging technology such as MIME.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e123"></a>Fast Infoset Documents as Attachments</h2></div></div></div><p>JAX-RPC supports the encoding of procedure call parameters and return values as MIME
            attachments. A SOAP message package with attachments is constructed using the MIME
                <code class="filename">multipart/related</code> type. This is typically accomplished by
            employing a MIME binding in the WSDL file. For example, the following snipet shows how
            to bind the <code class="filename">addPhoto</code> operation so that it returns the
                <code class="filename">status</code> part as a MIME attachment. </p><div class="example"><a name="d0e137"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Binding a part to a MIME attachment</b></p><pre class="programlisting">        &lt;wsdl:operation name="addPhoto"&gt;
            &lt;wsdl:input&gt;
                ...
            &lt;/wsdl:input&gt;
            
            &lt;wsdl:output&gt;
                &lt;mime:multipartRelated&gt;
                    &lt;mime:part&gt;
                        &lt;soap:body use="literal"/&gt;
                    &lt;/mime:part&gt;
                    &lt;mime:part&gt;
                        &lt;!-- Use application/fastinfoset to indicate an FI attachment --&gt;
                        &lt;mime:content part="status" type="application/fastinfoset"/&gt;
                    &lt;/mime:part&gt;
                &lt;/mime:multipartRelated&gt;
            &lt;/wsdl:output&gt;
        &lt;/wsdl:operation&gt;</pre></div><p> This binding indicates not only that the <code class="filename">status</code> part is
            bound to a MIME part but also that the type of this attachment is
                <code class="filename">application/fastinfoset</code>, that is, a Fast Infoset document.</p><p>JAX-RPC uses the Java Beans Activation framework to support various MIME content
            types. The WSDL/XML to Java mapping in JAX-RPC will map the <code class="filename">status</code>
            part defined above to an instance of <code class="filename">javax.activation.DataHandler</code>
            whose content is of type <code class="filename">org.jvnet.fastinfoset.FastInfosetSource</code>.
            Thus, the return statement of the <code class="filename">addPhoto</code> operation would create
            an instance of <code class="filename">DataHandler</code> as shown below.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e166"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Fast Infoset Attachments in Java</b></p><pre class="programlisting">        public javax.activation.DataHandler addPhoto(...)
            throws java.rmi.RemoteException 
        {
            ...
            return new DataHandler(
                new FastInfosetSource(...), "application/fastinfoset");
        }</pre></div><p>

            attachments in JAX-RPC and to [<a href="#FI-Java.net"><span class="abbrev">Fast Infoset @ Java.net</span></a>] for more information on how
            to use Fast Infoset sources and results. The example used in this section is available
            as part of the set of JAX-RPC samples in
            <code class="filename">$JWSDP_HOME/jaxrpc/samples</code>.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e181"></a>Web Services Security</h2></div></div></div><p>JWSDP 2.0 also includes support for XML and Web Services Security (XWSS). This library
            is integrated into JAX-RPC and can be used to define message level security in Web
            services conversations. Message-level security has a number of advantages over transport
            level solutions in that security information, as an intrinsic part of a message, can
            persist over the lifetime of a connection. In addition, XWSS supports features such as
            signing, which are not commonly supported in transport-level protocols. </p><p>Even though it is conceivably possible to modify the XWSS library to support Fast
            Infoset natively (e.g., by extending it to support a canonical version of Fast Infoset),
            we have decided against it at this point due to a lack of (i) interoperable standards
            and (ii) empirical evidence showing a significant performance improvement in switching
            to a binary encoding. Research in this area is currently undergoing at Sun as well as at
            the ITU-T and ISO study groups, so readers should anticipate more information about
            these research directions. </p><p>Conceptually, the operation of securing a message can be regarded as an
                <span class="emphasis"><em>infoset transformation</em></span>, which is guided by certain
            configuration parameters defined by the application's developer. In this sense, securing
            a message takes place after its infoset is produced and before it is serialized;
            conversely, unsecuring a message takes place after a message is parsed and before it is
            consumed. Therefore, Fast Infoset can still be used as the on-the-wire encoding without
            affecting these two pre-serialization and post-parsing steps. <sup>[<a name="LexicalSpace" href="#ftn.LexicalSpace">1</a>]</sup> Note that this approach still requires the use of an XML parser and an XML
            serializer (or XML canonicalizer) during the message securing and unsecuring phases. In
            particular, an XML parser is required to process decrypted fragments and an XML
            canonicalizer is required to both generate and verify signatures.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e197"></a>Performance</h2></div></div></div><p>As the saying goes, when it comes to performance, "your mileage will vary." Fast
            Infoset is designed to optimize parsing and serialization, so the key to understanding
            the potential gains associated with using this technology is understanding the
            percentage of time your application spends in these two tasks. The greater the
            percentage, the greater the improvement will be.</p><p>As part of the source code available from the Fast Infoset @ Java.net project [<a href="#FI-Java.net"><span class="abbrev">Fast Infoset @ Java.net</span></a>], there is a tool called Japex that we have used to write a
            number of different micro-benchmarks for our Fast Infoset implementation. All these
            performance reports are available from the project's Web page. To summarize, parsing
            micro-benchmarks show an average improvement of 3-10X depending on the XML parser in
            question, and JAX-RPC micro-benchmarks show an improvement of 2-5X depending on the
            structure of the messages exchanged &#8212;with the higher improvements achieved
            when base64 encoding is avoided. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e206"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div></div><p>Fast Infoset @ Java.net [<a href="#FI-Java.net"><span class="abbrev">Fast Infoset @ Java.net</span></a>] is still a young project, and
            the performance potentials of this technology are yet to be fully explored (especially
            in relation to advanced features like encoding algorithms, restricted alphabets and
            external vocabularies). The integration of Fast Infoset into JAX-RPC 1.1.3_01 EA is just a
            first step towards understanding the benefits of using this technology to speed up Web
            services. Future versions of JAX-RPC and JWSDP will provide support for many more of the
            advanced features defined in the Fast Infoset specification.</p><p>Your experience and feedback using this technology are important! Please refer to the
