<h1>What This Release Includes</h1>

  <p>This release implements the <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/jaxrpc.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>for XML-based RPC 1.1 Specification</a>. In addition to the features required by the specification, this release provides the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Serializers and deserializers for most Collection types</li>

    <li>Configurable support for SSL-based authentication</li>

    <li>Data binding for rpc and document literal operations</li>

    <li>Support for these types: <code>xsd:any</code>, <code>xsd:anyType</code>, <code>xsd:IDREF</code> (to allow for strict compliance to the specs, support for these types is disabled when <code>wscompile</code> is run with the <code>-f:strict</code> option.)</li>
  </ul>

<a name="new"> </a>
<h1>What's New in This Release</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Support for WS-I Basic Profile 1.1</li>

    <li>Support for WS-I Attachment Profile 1.0</li>

    <li>Support for WS-I Simple SOAP Binding Profile 1.0</li>
  </ul>

<a name="limitations"> </a>
<h1>Current Limitations</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>You cannot start from an interface when using WS-I Attachment Profile 1.0. You must start with a WSDL.</li>

    <li>Collection classes are not supported with DII and dynamic proxies.</li>

    <li>Namespace-to-package mapping is not supported for dynamic proxies.</li>

    <li>The implementation of dynamic proxy and DII does not support multi-dimensional arrays for doc/literal and rpc/literal.</li>

    <li>This limitation concerns the return type for the <code>javax.xml.rpc.Call.getOutputParameters</code> method. In JAX-RPC 1.0.3 and earlier versions, the <code>getOutputParameters</code> method returned a <code>Map</code> where the keys were <code>QNames</code>. According to the JAX-RPC 1.1 Specification (section 8.2.4.1) this method should return a <code>Map</code> where the keys are of type <code>String</code>. This is also consistent with the JAX-RPC 1.1 API docs. This fix may cause backward compatabilities if the client expects the keys to be of type <code>QName</code>.</li>

    <li>While the JAXRPC 1.1 Specification (section 8.2.4.1) says that a DII <code>call.invoke</code> method must throw a remote exception if an exception is received from the service, the specification is not clear on what type of exception the dynamic proxy client may throw. Therefore, this client needs to be prepared to receive either one of these possible exceptions: <code>ServiceSpecificException</code>, <code>SOAPFaultException</code>, and <code>RemoteException</code>.</li>
  </ul>

<a name="bugs"> </a>
<h1>Known Bugs</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>JAX-RPC 1.1 would sometimes incorrectly mark some elements used by fault messages as nillable. This bug was fixed in JAX-RPC 1.1.2. However, due to the non-deterministic aspect of when these elements were marked nillable, it is not possible to guarantee that the <code>-source 1.1</code> or <code>-source 1.1.1</code> option will be able to generate the same WSDL.</li>

    <li>If there is a <code>null</code> parameter in a remote procedure call made by a DII or dynamic proxy client, the parameter is not serialized properly. (4847980)</li>

    <li>This release does not support DII and dynamic proxy for the document literal and wrapper style. It is conformant with the WS-I Basic Profile Document literal mappings. (4855319)</li>

    <li>On Windows, <code>wscompile.bat</code> cannot parse comma-separated features on the command line. To specify features, use <code>-f:&lt;<i>feature</i>&gt;</code> for each feature.<br>

      <p><b>Incorrect</b><br>
      <code>wscompile.bat -f:feature1,feature2</code></p>

      <p><b>Correct</b><br>
      <code>wscompile.bat -f:feature1 -f:feature2</code></p>
    </li>

    <li>JAX-RPC cannot fully round-trip <code>Calendar</code> objects that have a time zone that includes a GMT offset with non-zero seconds. For example, a GMT time zone offset of GMT-11:00:04 cannot be round tripped because the XML schema <code>dateTime</code> format does not allow for the specification of seconds in the GMT offset.</li>
