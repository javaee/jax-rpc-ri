    /*
    NOTE - According to the XSD spec, an annotation doesn't belong here,
           yet the WSDL spec relies on being able to specify non-schema
           attributes in cases such as this:
     
      <s:complexType name="ArrayOfItemsItem">
        <s:complexContent mixed="false">
          <s:restriction base="soapenc:Array">
            <s:attribute n1:arrayType="s0:ItemsItem[]"
                ref="soapenc:arrayType"
                xmlns:n1="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" />
          </s:restriction>
        </s:complexContent>
      </s:complexType>
     
           In this case, given that there is a "ref" attribute, the attribute
           declaration schema component should really be the corresponding
           top-level component, but then adding an annotation with the
           "n1:arrayType" attribute to it would be visible outside this
           complexType!
