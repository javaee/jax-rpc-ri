/**
 * <p> XMLReader provides a high-level streaming parser interface
 * for reading XML documents. </p>
 *
 * <p> The {@link #next} method is used to read events from the XML document. </p>
 *
 * <p> Each time it is called, {@link #next} returns the new state of the reader. </p>
 *
 * <p> Possible states are: BOF, the initial state, START, denoting the start
 * tag of an element, END, denoting the end tag of an element, CHARS, denoting
 * the character content of an element, PI, denoting a processing instruction,
 * EOF, denoting the end of the document. </p>
 *
 * <p> Depending on the state the reader is in, one or more of the following
 * query methods will be meaningful: {@link #getName}, {@link #getURI},
 * {@link #getLocalName}, {@link #getAttributes}, {@link #getValue}. </p>
 *
 * <p> Elements visited by a XMLReader are tagged with unique IDs. The ID of the
 * current element can be found by calling {@link #getElementId}. </p>
 *
 * <p> A XMLReader is always namespace-aware, and keeps track of the namespace
 * declarations which are in scope at any time during streaming. The
 * {@link #getURI(java.lang.String)} method can be used to find the URI
 * associated to a given prefix in the current scope. </p>
 *
 * <p> XMLReaders can be created using a {@link XMLReaderFactory}. </p>
 *
 * <p> Some utility methods, {@link #nextContent} and {@link #nextElementContent}
 * make it possible to ignore whitespace and processing instructions with
 * minimum impact on the client code. </p>
 *
 * <p> Similarly, the {@link #skipElement} and {@link #skipElement(int elementId)}
 * methods allow to skip to the end tag of an element ignoring all its content. </p>
 *
 * <p> Finally, the {@link #recordElement} method can be invoked when the XMLReader
 * is positioned on the start tag of an element to record the element's contents
 * so that they can be played back later. </p>
